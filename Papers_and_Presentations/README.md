Papers
======
## counting_available
- Topics including introduction on image processing, introduction on the system, 
problem statement, objective, studies approach and method and technique on the existing system. 


## digital_image_processing_object_detection

- This paper uses techniques like color processing and shape detection in MATLAB to detect and allocate an object 
(a mango because they have a color diffrent from their background) 


## image_processing

- Definitions and an introduction to things like types of neighborhoods, convolutions,
fourier transformsprobability density and distribution functions of the brightness, and
noise. 
- Seems very informative. 4 stars.  


## intelligent_management_system

- A method of analysing an aerial view of the car park is presented step by step. 
- The process finds car park coordinates from an empty car park, gets an image, 
converts the image to black and white, removes noise, and determines vacancy. 
- The limitation of this process is weather conditions.


## intelligent_system

- Explains a parking space detection system based on image processing by finding the 
rounded brown image drawn at each parking lot as a reference for image detection.
- Tested on 8 parking spaces, works well, no admitted limitations.


## key_point_recognition_randomized

- A 3-D object detection system that has reduced run-time computational complexity. 
- Also shows a simple and fast keypoint detector suffices to support detection.
- Uses statistical learning techniques.


## parking_lot_space_detection

- This system extracts features by generating detection patchs and building a Gaussian 
ground model from input video frames. Then the model is used to train an eight-class 
multi-SVM classifier. 
- The classification is optimized globally by applying Markov Random Field. 


## vacant_parking_space_detection

- This algorithm uses a combination of car feature point detection and color histogram 
classification to detect vacant parking spaces in static overhead images. 
- This paper is more of an evaluation of different individual algorithms
